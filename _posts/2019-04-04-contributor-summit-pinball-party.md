If you're planning on attending the Puppet Contributor Summit this year, 4-5 June in Budapest, I'm excited to announce that Vox Pupuli will be hosting a special social event on 3 June 2019 at the Budapest [Pinball Museum](http://www.flippermuzeum.hu/! We welcome all attendees to enjoy some food and drinks and get to know our fellow community.

While we don’t have all the details locked down yet, we'll be there in the late afternoon/evening when we hope to catch most everyone as they arrive in the city. The Pinball Museum is one of Budapest’s top attractions and we’ve reserved it especially for our event. How cool is it that we get this place to ourselves?!

## Come hang out with us

According to the interwebs, this museum is Hungary's first and Europe's largest continuously operating interactive pinball exhibition. It's got unlimited trial of more than 130 pinball machines! The museum has had a long standing 5-star rating on TripAdvisor and earned the Traveller's Choice Award for 2015 - their highest acknowledgement.

The Puppet Community team is drumming up a bunch of fun activities and posting them on the [agenda page](https://puppet.com/puppetize/contributor-summit/agenda). If you'd like to organize something, you can add it to that list too. Budapest is a really neat city with all kinds of weird and quirky things that will make for a really good time.

Stay tuned - more details coming soon! Check out the [museum's awesome photo gallery](http://www.flippermuzeum.hu/en/photo-gallery/picture-gallery.html) in the meantime.

Have a great week!
